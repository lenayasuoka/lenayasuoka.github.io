    <p>A new embodiment of a previous collaborative project through the eyes of one of its members.</br></br> 
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In the transitional period from student towards something else, it feels important 
        to look back at previous works and identify, with timely distance, what is still 
        relatable while also letting it suggest something different. This project is a 
        rite of passage as well as a subjective and evocative information design work. </p></br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Gathering materials from an abundant and half-forgotten digital archive, the images 
        are put in the physical process of film photography. Working with the reversed image 
        of the past, the negatives are constantly studied and questioned in a methodological 
        reexamination and (chemical) transformation. Today, where should light be put on? 
        In this more than situational project, the physicality of the medium correlates 
        with its symbolic meaning. </p></br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The final audiovisual piece combines narration, superimposition and handmade frame-by-frame 
        stabilization to establish new viewpoints on the work. The narrator rediscovers the awe of 
        witnessing a Nature that is too often claimed understood and dominated. As an installation,
        immerged in the water of a reflective pond, the transformed images are revealed in a continuous collage. </p></br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> In this peculiar time, reworking earlier pieces in a new situation proves an ongoing 
        attentiveness to things. As much as this rite of passage marks that time has passed, 
        following its process is a support through it, revitalizing individual action, 
        helping to respond to a fragile moment of existence. </p>
