  I am the Mayor and I have a big house. 
  A Japanese old tree fortress with white roof tiles. 
  Compared to other houses in the town, it is sequoia huge. 
  I have been working on it for almost four years now. 
  Time and money went into making each room bigger one after the other,
   to realise my dreams of atmospheric spaces that keep coming up in my fruity mind.
    A lot of money indeed was versed to Mr Nook.
     He is in charge of all additional house construction in town and charges moon-size prices for it. 
     Flowers die if I run them over, Mr Nook’s prices are high and there is nothing I can do about either,
      even as the town mayor!
      <br><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
  Lucky clover, when I first moved into this town, 
  I got financial help from my friend Xiuli.
   She’s as rich as the sea, and every grain of sand the could lend me she did.
    One clear night, when the owls are awake, 
    she came to my town with all the bells she could fit in her pockets. 
    As she lays dozens of gold ringing bags in front of the train station, 
    I run in circles around her to express my gratitude. 
    But as balloons drift away and cicadas die, all those bells were spent. 
    It all went into Nook’s estate and filled his fat jumping belly. 
    Soon I had nothing left. 
    I had to work to earn bells and water my ambitious house planters. </p>

    Walls and carpets are aged, showing stains that will never go away. 
    A lot of work has taken place in such a room and continues to take place.
     A schedule is even showing on the whiteboard. 
     So many things to do! Like building a miniature spaceship? It looks almost done,
      the tool box is still open next to it.
       Against the wall, the sink and dishes are getting as sloppy as it can get. 
       Will I take the time to tend to its flowers? 
       On the floor, a bucket is infinitely filling up as water drips from the ceiling. 
       What on earth is happening upstairs? 
       The sound of each drops accompanies my drumming sessions and serves as a very slow metronome to work on my tempo.
    I recently acquired a radiator to get rid of the humidity in this unsanitary room. 
    Too much water in the air is bad for my cactuses and the books next to my computer. 
    On the shelves you can find books such as 
    <i>Miniature making at home, Drum stick control, and How to be a good Mayor.</i> I also have <i>Cutting fish like a chef, Aquarium maintenance, How to grow interior grass, Wheat, The art of bonsai and flower arrangement</i>, and some mangas. Why all these books? Check out my other rooms!</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
    An indoor garden. Plant furniture thrives on my grassy carpet. 
    Mushrooms grow from the damp air of the adjacent room. 
    Shiny apples awaits my dusk craving as I lay on the bed, my head resting on a large dewdrop. 
    I awake from an insect filled dream by my sapling clock and the nestlings high on the wall.
     I water my plants, tend to my bonsai, 
     and choose my clothes that carry the scent of the pear wardrobe they’re patiently folded into. 
     I can get out and bring about my mayor duties as I am filled with earthy energy!</p>

      This room is where I store harvested fruits from the town in wicker baskets; 
      peaches, durians, lychees, apples and even bamboo shoots. 
      I will soon harvest my wheat plants and craft tatamis out of it for my zen friends.
       But for now, I need to wait just a bit more and I do so by making tea and eating my onigiris to build up some strength.
        When someone comes over, they sometimes agree to help me batter rice in my mochi pestle, 
        this is hard work! I always keep a bowl of stew ready to thank them. </p>

          After a hard day’s work I can relax in a hot bath. 
          I look at my goldfish swimming next to me and imagine what it could be to live underwater,
           my work as a mayor would be completely different I am sure! While I marinate in my bath salts, 
           I listen to the purring of the washing machine.</p>

            Upstairs you can find an exhibition space for bonsais made by inhabitants and myself.
             This is also a space dedicated to learning and transmission.
              I organise workshops and classes about bonsai tending and flower arrangement. Open to everyone!</p>

                From Thursday to Sunday, I open an evening restaurant downstairs where I serve freshly caught seafood. 
                I prepare a variety of sashimis and sushis that I present on big sharing plates.
                 This week I caught some octopus so I am also preparing takoyaki on my grill. 
                 In a big basket lays some veggies that will either get pickled or go into the big cauldron for a tasty soup.
                  The restaurant is famous around town and quickly gets crowded. 
                  For the people that patiently wait for their turn to eat
                   I give a portion of veggie bouillon to prepare their belly for the feast to come. 
                   Certain evenings, the whole town coincidently reunites here and around the end of the service
                    I can harvest the complaints the habitants might have about the town.
                     If some talkers are drunk it can turn into a pretty intense debate! 
                     Every problem that might arise gets its time and we come up with solutions altogether. 
                     This is pretty beautiful moment to witness. 
                     When it’s very late and I start putting people out the kindest are staying a bit to help with the dishes. 
                     God I love my town!</p>
